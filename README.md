# Mula [cryptofcurrency price app]

This project was created using the MERN stack for my fourth and final project at General Assembly. The application was built over the course of a week, and as a challenge for myself, I decided to go solo, to allow myself to get a better understanding of how the frontend and backend interact with one another.

## Brief
The brief required the consumption of data from a third party APIs and all the basic CRUD operations to create a functional and interactive full stack application. 

## What is it exactly
Initially, the application was intended to allow the user to buy and sell cryptocurrency as well as maintaining a digital wallet, but due to some obstacles and and constraints, the app currently only displays cryptos and their details.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
React

### Backend
Express, Node.js, MongoDB


## APIs Utilized
### CoinGecko
An independently sourced crypto data such as live prices, NFT floor prices, trading volume, exchange volumes, trading pairs, historical data, contract address data, crypto categories, crypto derivatives, images and more.

### Cloudinary
A cloud-based image and video management service with an API that enables developers to easily upload, manipulate, optimize, and deliver media assets in real-time.


### Deployment
The application was deployed using Render and can be viewed here.


## Future Enhancements
I would love to come back to this and intergrate the ability to make transactions, as well as using a more effecient API as the current one can be quite glitchy.

## In Conclusion
This was a chaotic yet insightful experience, and it was a great opportunity for me to explore React and the endless possibilities it offers.
